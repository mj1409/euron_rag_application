Gireesh's Journey: From DevOps Engineer to AI Observability Visionary
Gireesh Reddy began his professional path deeply rooted in the fast-paced world of DevOps and Observability Engineering. With over 6 years of industry experience, he carved a niche in designing scalable CI/CD pipelines, secure infrastructure, and enterprise observability across cloud platforms like Azure, AWS, and GCP.

🏢 Career Timeline:
Adadyn  – Associate System Engineer

Mediamint – System Engineer

Nuviso Networks Pvt Ltd – DevOps Engineer

IBM – Network DevOps Engineer

Across these roles, Gireesh mastered tools such as:

Terraform, ARM, Bicep for IaC

Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Jenkins for CI/CD

Kubernetes, Helm, AKS, EKS for orchestration

Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, ELK, Datadog, New Relic for monitoring & tracing

Python, Shell, Go (learning) for automation

The Spark of Curiosity: Observability Meets Intelligence
While leading observability initiatives using stacks like Prometheus + Grafana or Loki + Tempo + Fluentd, Gireesh started asking:

“What if logs, traces, and metrics could be interpreted semantically?”

“Can LLMs surface root causes faster than humans?”

“Could RAG pipelines help operations teams debug and heal systems faster?”

The Hobby Project That Lit the Fire
Gireesh set up a local Kubernetes cluster and deployed an end-to-end RAG + Observability stack, using:

Helm & Terraform for automated deployment

OpenTelemetry-instrumented Node.js apps for telemetry data

FAISS for semantic search over chunks of logs/metrics/traces

LangChain + Local LLM (Euron API) for generating intelligent summaries

He didn’t just log errors — he built a system that explains them.

From Engineer to Architect of AIOps
This hobby turned vision:
Gireesh began his transition from DevOps to AI Observability Architect — combining the worlds of SRE, ML, and cloud-native automation.

He now explores:

✅ LLMOps to manage, monitor, and deploy large language models

✅ AIOps to correlate anomalies and create self-healing pipelines

✅ RAG pipelines on top of operational data for real-time root cause assistance

✅ Cosine similarity & vector DBs to query observability data like memory

His toolchain includes:

OpenTelemetry, Tempo, Loki, Vector DBs (FAISS, ChromaDB)

LangChain, Euron APIs, and embedding models

All deployed via Azure DevOps Pipelines using Terraform + Helm into AKS

The Road Ahead
Now preparing for senior platform and AI Observability roles, Gireesh is building a portfolio that showcases:

Real-world RAG + Observability integrations

End-to-end cloud-native automation

A mindset geared toward platform intelligence and proactive reliability

While others monitor infrastructure, he’s building systems that understand it.

While others run pipelines, he’s building pipelines that reason.

Gireesh isn’t just future-proofing his skills — he’s helping shape the future of DevOps and AIOps.
